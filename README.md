# Module 4 Challenge
## Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz
<sub> In this challenge we were tasked with creating a website to help us better understand JavaScript by taking a time quiz.
It is done when the user clicks "start" a timer starts and is given a question. When all the questions are answered or the timer runs out
the test is over and the user can then chose to restart the test. </sub>
